The best method of detecting these web shells is to compare a verified benign version of the web application </p><p> </p><ul><li><p>Web Traffic Anomaly Detection</p></li></ul><p>While attackers often design web shells to blend in with normal web traffic, some characteristics are difficult to imitate without advanced knowledge. These characteristics include user agent strings and client Internet Protocol (IP) address space. Prior to having a presence on a network, attackers are unlikely to know which user agents or IP addresses are typical for a web server, so web shell requests will appear anomalous. In addition, web shells routing attacker traffic will default to the web server’s user agent and IP address, which should be unusual in network traffic. Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) exclusively accessed by anomalous user agents are potentially web shells</p><p> </p><ul><li><p>Signature-Based Detection </p></li></ul><p>Some cyber actors use popular web shells (e.g., China Chopper, WSO, C99, B374K, R57) with minimal modification. In these cases, fingerprint or expression-based detection may be possible.</p><p> </p><ul><li><p>Unexpected Network Flows </p></li></ul><p>In some cases, attackers use web shells on systems other than web servers (e.g., workstations). These web shells operate on rogue web server applications and can evade file-based detection by running exclusively in memory (i.e., fileless execution). While functionally similar to a traditional Remote Access Tool (RAT), these types of web shells allow attackers to easily chain malicious traffic through a uniform platform. These types of web shells can be detected on well managed networks because they listen and respond on previously unused ports</p><p> </p><ul><li><p>Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Capabilities</p></li></ul><p>Some EDR and enhanced host logging solutions may be able to detect web shells based on system call or process lineage abnormalities. These security products monitor each process on the endpoint including invoked system calls.

There is a myriad of approaches for detecting a pseudo-randomly generated domain name, including using frequency analysis, Markov chains, entropy, proportion of dictionary words, ratio of vowels to other characters, and more. CDN domains may trigger these detections due to the format of their domain names. In addition to detecting a DGA domain based on the name, another more general approach for detecting a suspicious domain is to check for recently registered names or for rarely visited domains.</p><p>Machine learning approaches to detecting DGA domains have been developed and have seen success in applications. One approach is to use N-Gram methods to determine a randomness score for strings used in the domain name. If the randomness score is high, and the domains are not whitelisted (CDN, etc), then it may be determined if a domain or related to a legitimate host or DGA.Another approach is to use deep learning to classify domains as DGA-generated</p><p></p><p>Monitor CommonSecurityLog that might have been generated by a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA). DGAs can be used by malware to generate rendezvous points that are difficult to predict in advance. This detection uses the Alexa Top 1 million domain names to build a model of what normal domains look like. It uses this to identify domains that may have been randomly generated by an algorithm. The triThreshold is set to 500 - increase this to report on domains that are less likely to have been randomly generated, decrease it for more likely. The start time and end time look back over 6 hours of data and the dgaLengthThreshold is set to 8 - meaning domains whose length is 8 or more are reported.</p><p></p><p><span style=\"color:#5E5E5E;\">DGA activity is detected by capturing and analyzing network packets, usually in five general steps.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:start;\"><b><span style=\"color:#5E5E5E;\">Step 1 – Detect DNS Application</span></b><span style=\"color:#5E5E5E;\"><br> Detection begins via DNS request and/or response messages. DNS is a fundamental Internet protocol, and most firewalls have a policy to allow outgoing DNS traffic on its reserved port 53. However, a hacker may take advantage of port 53 to send its traffic without adherence to the standard DNS message format. This attack is called DNS tunneling. A Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) Engine is recommended to identify the DNS applications more precisely.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:start;\"><b><span style=\"color:#5E5E5E;\">Step 2 – Extract Domain Names</span></b><span style=\"color:#5E5E5E;\"><br> Once a network application is identified as DNS, the domain names in the DNS query and response messages need to be extracted. In order to extract the right domain name, the DNS message’s content needs to be parsed carefully and a DPI engine is required to perform this task.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:start;\"><b><span style=\"color:#5E5E5E;\">Step 3 – Detect any DGA</span></b><span style=\"color:#5E5E5E;\"><br> Analysis needs to be performed on the domains extracted from DNS messages to determine whether they are DGAs. This is perhaps the most complicated step. The challenge is to reduce both false positives as well as false negatives. </span></p><p style=\"text-align:start;\"><b><span style=\"color:#5E5E5E;\">Step 4 – Detect Registered DGA Domains</span></b><span style=\"color:#5E5E5E;\"><br> In order to detected whether a DGA domain name is registered, DNS responses need to be checked. Merely tracking DNS requests is not sufficient – the detection system should track the entire transaction to facilitate correlation between pieces of information.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:start;\"><b><span style=\"color:#5E5E5E;\">Step 5 – Detect Traffic to Registered DGA Domains</span></b><span style=\"color:#5E5E5E;\"><br> When most existing DGA detection systems focus on detecting whether a domain name is a DGA domain, they often forget the last question, the most important one: is there any traffic that has been sent to the registered DGA domains? In order to detect this in a timely fashion, DGA domain detection must be tightly coupled with network traffic inspection. The results need to be echoed back to the traffic inspection engine immediately before any damage is done.</span></p><p></p><p></p>",

In a traditional brute force attack, the perpetrator attempts to gain unauthorized access to a single account by guessing the password repeatedly in a very short period of time by using word list or automated tools. In a Password Spraying attack, the attacker technique is “spraying” the same password across many accounts before trying another password. Typically used against single sign-on (SSO) and cloud-based applications.</span></p><p><b>Purpose: </b></p><p>Identifies evidence of password spray activity against Azure AD applications by looking for failures from multiple accounts from the same IP address within a time window. If the number of accounts breaches the threshold just once, all failures from the IP address within the time range are bought into the result. Details on whether there were successful authentications by the IP address within the time window are also included.

ACS enforces a uniform network-access security policy for network administrators and other network users.</p><p style=\"text-align:-webkit-left;\">ACS supports a broad variety of Cisco and other network-access devices (NADs), also known as AAA clients.</p><p style=\"text-align:-webkit-left;\"></p><h4 style=\"text-align:start;\">Overview of PEAP</h4><p style=\"text-align:start;\">PEAP is a client-server security architecture that you use to encrypt EAP transactions, thereby protecting the contents of EAP authentications. PEAP uses server-side public key certificates to authenticate the server.</p><p style=\"text-align:start;\">It then creates an encrypted SSL/TLS tunnel between the client and the authentication server. The ensuing exchange of authentication information to authenticate the client is then encrypted and user credentials are safe from eavesdropping.</p><p style=\"text-align:start;\">PEAP is similar to EAP-TLS but uses a different client authentication method. PEAP provides authentication, by using server certificates, a TLS tunnel and client authentication through that encrypted tunnel. Unlike EAP-TLS, PEAP requires the client to use another EAP type, like EAP-MSCHAPv2.</p><p style=\"text-align:start;\">PEAP authentications always involve two phases:</p><ul>\n<li><p>In phase1, the end-user client authenticates ACS. This action requires a server certificate and authenticates ACS to the end-user client, ensuring that the user or machine credentials sent in phase two are sent to a AAA server that has a certificate issued by a trusted CA. The first phase uses a TLS handshake to establish an SSL tunnel between the end-user client and the AAA server.</p></li>\n<li><p>In the second phase, ACS authenticates the user or machine credentials by using an EAP authentication protocol. The SSL tunnel that was created in phase1 protects the EAP authentication.</p></li>\n</ul><p style=\"text-align:start;\"><b>Note</b> Depending on the end-user client involved, the CA certificate for the CA that issued the ACS server certificate is likely to be required in local storage for trusted root CAs on the end-user client computer.</p>",
